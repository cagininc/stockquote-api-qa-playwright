# 🧪 soap-api-playwright

**Automated Playwright tests for a SOAP-based StockQuote API, including functional and performance checks.**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

I built a **Node.js** server that exposes a SOAP endpoint for real-time stock quotes by proxying Alpha Vantage’s REST API.  
Using the **Serverless Framework**, I deployed this service on **AWS Lambda**, and set up **CloudWatch** dashboards to monitor invocation counts, error rates and response times.  
This test suite validates that the live Lambda endpoint:

- ✅ **Functional Validation** of XML requests/responses  
- ⚡ **Performance Awareness** via response-time assertions  
- 🧩 **Modular Design** (helpers, data-driven tests)  
- 📈 **Professional Reporting** with Allure
